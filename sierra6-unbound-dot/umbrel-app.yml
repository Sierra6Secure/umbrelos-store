version: "0.9.9"
port: 5335
description: >-
  A validating, caching DNS forwarder configured exclusively for DNS over TLS (DoT).


  By running Unbound on your Umbrel with this specific configuration, your DNS queries are wrapped in a secure TLS tunnel before leaving your network. This prevents your ISP or local attackers from snooping on your browsing habits or hijacking your DNS requests.

  
  Key Technical Features:
    - Protocol: Operates as a "Caching Forwarder" using DNS over TLS (DoT) for maximum privacy.

    - Security: Enforces encrypted communication via Port 853 to trusted upstream providers (Cloudflare/Quad9).

    - Privacy: Employs forward-tls-upstream: yes and forward-first: no to ensure that if an encrypted connection cannot be established, the system will never fall back to an unsecure, cleartext query.

    - Validation: Supports DNSSEC to ensure the integrity of the records received, protecting you from "spoofing" attacks.

    - Integration: Perfectly optimized to serve as the upstream resolver for Pi-hole, creating a complete ad-blocking and privacy-hardened pipeline.

releaseNotes: >-
  v0.9.9: Initial Security Hardening

  - Core Logic: Configured as a high-performance caching forwarder with mandatory DNS over TLS (DoT).


  - Security Policy: Implemented forward-tls-upstream: yes and forward-first: no. This strictly prevents any "cleartext leaks" by ensuring the resolver will fail rather than send unencrypted data if the TLS handshake fails.


  - Upstream: Optimized for Cloudflare’s encrypted anycast network via Port 853.


  - Pi-hole Ready: Set to listen on internal Port 53 for seamless integration with local ad-blocking containers.


  - DNSSEC: Enabled hardware-accelerated signature validation to prevent DNS hijacking and spoofing.



  

  Roadmap: Continuous Improvement

  - Dashboard UI: Upcoming feature to allow graphical management of upstream providers and TLS certificates.


  - Dynamic Tuning: Currently, manual overrides are available via editing unbound.conf within the app data directory.


  - Log Management: Future updates will include automated log rotation to manage disk space for users requiring high-verbosity debugging.
